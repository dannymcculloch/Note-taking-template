Hi, this is a template configuration for Obsidian to use to sync up all your notes to Github and beyond. 

### How to use the repo
First, you'll want to use [Mendeley **desktop**](https://www.mendeley.com/guides/desktop) to read and **organise** your papers. To do this:
- Download the app
- Set a watched folder where you can just drag and drop papers and Mendeley will read them in
